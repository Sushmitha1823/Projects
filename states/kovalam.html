    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Kovalam is a coastal town located about 16 km from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. The name ‚ÄúKovalam‚Äù means a grove of coconut trees, and the region truly lives up to its name with a beautiful coastline lined with swaying palms. Historically, it was a quiet fishing village with minimal outside contact. The beach remained relatively unknown until the early 20th century, when its natural beauty started gaining attention from the royal family of Travancore and select European guests.

      During the 1920s and 30s, Kovalam gained prominence due to the patronage of Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore, who built a beach resort in the area. This led to an increase in elite and aristocratic visits, particularly from British officials and foreign dignitaries. The calm waters and crescent-shaped shoreline made it a retreat for leisure and health. The Vizhinjam Lighthouse, built nearby in the 19th century, became a key maritime landmark and enhanced Kovalam‚Äôs appeal.
      
      The real transformation of Kovalam came in the 1970s when it became a popular stop on the overland Hippie Trail. Western backpackers traveling through Asia discovered Kovalam as a peaceful, exotic destination. This marked the beginning of international tourism in the area. Caf√©s, guesthouses, Ayurvedic centers, and art shops began to emerge, transforming Kovalam from a quiet village into a thriving global destination known for relaxation, yoga, and wellness.
      
      Kovalam is often credited as the beach that introduced Kerala to the global tourism circuit. It played a significant role in developing the state‚Äôs reputation for wellness tourism, particularly Ayurveda and yoga. Over time, it has evolved into a blend of traditional culture and modern amenities. The local fishing community still operates alongside luxury resorts, and the beach continues to draw thousands of visitors annually, both for its natural beauty and its legacy as one of India‚Äôs pioneering beach destinations.
